    <ol>
        <li>
            Gather all ingredients.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in boiling water, stirring occasionally,
            until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes; drain, then rinse with cold water to cool.
        </li>

            Meanwhile, whisk together soy sauce, teriyaki sauce, honey, and ginger in a small bowl; set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat oil in a large skillet or wok over high heat. Cook and stir celery, carrots, onion, and green onions in
            hot oil until slightly tender, 5 to 7 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add spaghetti and soy sauce mixture. Cook, stirring frequently, until heated through, about 5 minutes.
